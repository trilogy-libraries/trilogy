/* Trilogy Non-blocking Client API
 *
 * This API is designed for allowing the caller to deal with I/O themselves.
 * The API is split into `_send` and `_recv` calls. Allowing the caller to wait
 * on writeability before calling a `_send` function, and waiting for
 * readability before `_recv` calls. This can especially be useful for
 * applications that live inside of managed runtime or event-loop.
 *
 * Some pseudo-code typical lifecycle of a connection might look something like
 * this:
 *
 *   trilogy_conn_t conn;
 *   trilogy_init(&conn);
 *
 *   trilogy_connect_send(&conn, addrinfo);
 *
 *   trilogy_handshake_t handshake;
 *   trilogy_connect_recv(&conn, &handshake);
 *
 *   trilogy_auth_send(&conn, &handshake, "root", NULL, 0, 0);
 *   int rc = trilogy_auth_recv(&conn, &handshake);
 *   if (rc == TRILOGY_AUTH_SWITCH) {
 *      trilogy_auth_switch_send(&conn, &handshake);
 *     trilogy_auth_recv(&conn, &handshake);
 *   }
 *
 * At this point the connection is open, authenticated, and ready for commands.
 * From here a caller can start issuing commands:
 *
 *   char* db_name = "test";
 *   trilogy_change_db_send(&conn, db_name, strlen(db_name));
 *   trilogy_change_db_recv(&conn);
 *
 * Assuming the connection isn't in an error state, and all responses have been
 * read off the network - it's ready for another command.
 *
 * Specific to the trilogy_query_send/trilogy_query_recv lifecycle - if
 * TRILOGY_HAVE_RESULTS is returned from trilogy_query_recv, the caller *must* read
 * all columns and rows from the server before the connection will be command-
 * ready again. This is a requirement of a MySQL-compatible protocol.
 *
 * trilogy_close_send/trilogy_close_recv may be used to sent a quit command to the
 * server. While this is considered best practice, simply calling trilogy_free
 * to close the socket and free any internal buffers is enough to clean things
 * up.
